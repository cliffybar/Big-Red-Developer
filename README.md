## Advanced CSS Callenge: Professional Portfolio

I have been tasked to create my very first portoflio as a UT Austin Coding Boot Camp student. To coincide with the respective module for this project, I have used advanced CSS properties such as flexbox and media queries to improve layout regardless of the screen size it is being viewed in.

## What to Expect

The portfolio contains 3 sections:

1. "About" Section
    - A brief summary of myself describing my path to joining the Coding Boot Camp.

2. "Works" Section
    - A showcase of finished apps and those "under construction."

3. "Reach" Section
    - The viewer is provided with 3 ways of contacting me: personal, social media, and a contact form.

## Languages Used

1. HTML
2. CSS
